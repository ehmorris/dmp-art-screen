# Artists
Here's what I'm thinkin' for a nice cross-section of history and avoidance of copyright stuff (roughly chronologically) (forgive me for being so western inclined, I don't know a lot about Asian/Pacific/Middle-Eastern/African/South-American art):

# Adding stuff
I'm thinking the process for adding a piece/arists should be:
* Fork this repo and create a PR w/ the following:
* Double check that you have a high quality / high fidelity piece of theirs, and that it's mostllllyyyy copyright free
* Update the readme w/ their info
* Actually create the page

*P.S. This uses my nice middleman base install repo: https://github.com/ehmorris/middleman-base-install*
