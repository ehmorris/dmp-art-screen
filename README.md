A lil' website to rotate the art on the big 1920x1080 screen in the room where I work

# Setup
* Run `bundle install`
* Run `middleman server --port 3000`
* To deploy, run `rake build`, then `rake publish`

# Artists
Here's what I'm thinkin' for a nice cross-section of history and avoidance of copyright stuff (roughly chronologically) (forgive me for being so western inclined, I don't know a lot about Asian/Pacific/Middle-Eastern/African/South-American art):
* Haring
* Basquiat
* Albers
* Kandinsky
* Lissitzky
* Goya
* Manet
* Van Eyck
* Giotto
* Hieroglyphs
* Cave Paintings

# Adding stuff
I'm thinking the process for adding a piece/arists should be:
* Fork this repo and create a PR w/ the following:
* Double check that you have a high quality / high fidelity piece of theirs, and that it's mostllllyyyy copyright free
* Update the readme w/ their info
* Actually create the page
